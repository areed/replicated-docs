# Configuring Role-Based Access Control

When an application is installed, [Kubernetes RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) resources are created to allow the Replicated admin console to manage the application.

By default, the admin console will create a ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding with permissions to all namespaces.
This behavior can be controlled by editing the Application custom resource manifest file. For more information about the Application manifest, see [Application](../reference/custom-resource-application) in the _Custom Resources_ section.

As listed above, an application can require cluster scoped access across all namespaces on all/wildcard k8 objects or to have access limited to its given namespace.
In either case, the user who installs an application with the kots CLI must have the wildcard privileges in the cluster.
If the user has insufficient privileges, the following error is shown when attempting to install or upgrade.

```bash
$  kubectl kots install appslug
  â€¢ Current user has insufficient privileges to install Admin Console.
For more information, please visit https://kots.io/vendor/packaging/rbac
To bypass this check, use the --skip-rbac-check flag
Error: insufficient privileges
```

For more information about installing an application with the kots CLI, see [install](../reference/kots-cli-install/) in the kots CLI documentation.

## Cluster-scoped access

For compatibility with earlier versions of the Replicated app manager, the default behavior of an application is to create a ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding with permissions to all namespaces.

Applications that need access to cluster-wide resources should continue to use cluster-scoped access installers.

#### Reference objects

The following ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding are created for cluster-scoped applications:

```yaml
apiVersion: "rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1"
kind: "ClusterRole"
metadata:
  name: "kotsadm-role"
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["*"]
    resources: ["*"]
    verbs: ["*"]
```

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: kotsadm-role
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: kotsadm
  namespace: appnamespace
```

The following Role and RoleBinding are created for namespace-scoped applications.

```yaml
apiVersion: "rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1"
kind: "Role"
metadata:
  name: "kotsadm-role"
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["*"]
    resources: ["*"]
    verbs: ["*"]
```

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: kotsadm-role
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: kotsadm
  namespace: appnamespace
```

## Namespace-scoped access

An application vendor can limit the role-based access control (RBAC) grants for the admin console to a single namespace by specifying one of the following options in the Application manifest file.

* `requireMinimalRBACPrivileges` - Applicable to existing clusters only. When set to `true`, the app manager creates a Role and RoleBinding, granting the admin console access to all resources in the namespace, but not to any resources outside of the namespace. If you want all customer installations to use minimal RBAC, use this option.

* `supportMinimalRBACPrivileges` - Applicable to existing clusters only. When set to `true`, the app manager enables a namespace-scoped Role and RoleBinding on a per-customer basis. Therefore, this setting is not triggered by default in the installation. You must also tell the end user to opt in using the `kots install` command with the `-- use-minimal-rbac` flag set to `true`.

### Preflight Checks and Support Bundles

Without access to cluster-scoped resources, some preflight checks and support bundle collectors are not be able to read the resources. These tools continue to function, but return less data. In this situation, the admin console presents an option for the user to either proceed with limited data or use the displayed `kubectl preflight` command to run the preflight checks or support bundle remotely with the user's RBAC authorizations. After the command runs, the results are automatically uploaded to the app manager.

**Example: `kubectl preflight` command**

```bash
curl https://krew.sh/preflight | bash
kubectl preflight secret/<namespace>/kotsadm-<appslug>-preflight
```

### Velero Namespace Access

Velero is a prerequisite for [admin console snapshots](../enterprise/snapshots-understanding). The namespace-scoped permission does not grant access to Velero's namespace if Velero is installed.

The `kubectl kots velero ensure-permissions` command can be used to create additional Roles and RoleBindings to allow the necessary cross-namespace access. For more information, see [`velero ensure-permissions`](../reference/kots-cli-velero-ensure-permissions/) in the kots CLI documentation.


### Air Gap Installations

Air gap installations honor the `requireMinimalRBACPrivileges` and `supportsMinimalRBACPrivileges` flags in [headless mode only](../enterprise/installing-existing-cluster-automation#airgap-install).
Without access to the internet or the application's `.airgap` package as provided in a headless install, the app manager does not have the information required to determine whether minimal RBAC is appropriate and so it defaults to the more permissive RBAC policy.

### Operators and multiple namespaces

It is possible to use namespace-scoped access for Operators and multi-namespace applications.
During the installation, if there are `additionalNamespaces` specified in the Application manifest, Roles and RoleBindings are created to give the admin console access to all specified namespaces.

To enable namespace-scoped access for an application:

```yaml
apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: my-application
spec:
  title: My Application
  icon: https://support.io/img/logo.png
  requireMinimalRBACPrivileges: true
```

#### Reference Objects

The following Role is created for namespace-scoped applications:

```yaml
apiVersion: "rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1"
kind: "Role"
metadata:
  name: "kotsadm-role"
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["*"]
    resources: ["*"]
    verb: "*"
```

:::note
The kotsadm-operator component receives an authorization for all verb, all resources and all apiGroups in the namespace.
:::

## Converting

The RBAC permissions are set during the initial installation. The admin console is running using the assumed identity and cannot change its own authorization. Changing the RBAC scope from cluster to namespace or from namespace to cluster affects only new installations of the application; existing installations continue to run with their current authorization.
For applications that need to elevate their permission from namespace to cluster, we recommend including a preflight check to ensure the permission is available.
